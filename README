This is the preliminary version of the lecture notes for the second
part of Discrete and Algorithmic Geometry (Universitat
Polit√®cnica de Catalunya), held in the fall semesters of 2011 and 2013 by Julian
Pfeifle.

These notes are fruit of the collaborative effort of all participating
students, who have taken turns in assembling this text. The name of
each scribe figures in each corresponding section.
